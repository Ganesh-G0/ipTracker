# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

In this challenge I have build this IP Address Tracker app and got it looking as close to the design as possible. 
To get the IP Address locations [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). 
To generate the map [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

A user is able to:
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
